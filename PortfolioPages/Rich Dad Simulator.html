                As one of four developers on this amazing game project that will be released by the end of 2023, I worked closely with my teammates to produce an innovative and engaging gaming experience. My specific responsibilities included 

                <ol type="circle">
                  <li>Developing a player notification system that alerted customers to their purchases and complaints about goods, and saved
                    them into the supermarket inventory/li>
                  <li>Setting up vehicles for the player, including pickup trucks, cargo trucks and cars</li>
                  <li>Implementing an NPC system that included pedestrian and environmental NPCs, with animation state machines for
                    pedestrian NPCs, as well as AI systems for customers, farm animals, and farmers.</li>
                  <li>Designing and implementing a player inventory system to manage and organize the player's goods and resources.</li>
                  <li>Developing a distributor shop system to allow players to sell and distribute their goods to customers.</li>
                  <li>Creating a farm finance system that allowed players to manage their finances and expenses throughout the game.
                  </li>
                </ol>

                Together, we tackled a wide range of development tasks, such as character and level design, sound effects, and gameplay mechanics. We also conducted extensive playtesting to ensure that the game was both enjoyable and well-balanced.

                Throughout the project, we faced a variety of difficulties, including optimizing game performance and seamlessly integrating new features. However, our team's excellent communication and problem-solving abilities allowed us to overcome these challenges.

                As the release date approaches, I am excited to see the culmination of our hard work and dedication. I believe that our team has created an exciting and immersive gaming experience that players will thoroughly enjoy.
